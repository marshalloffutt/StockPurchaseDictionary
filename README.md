## StockPurchaseDictionary

A console app exploration of Collections and Linq. We define and instantiate a Dictionary called stocks, and add stocks to the Dictionary. We create a list of ValueTuples that represent stock purchases with properties being `ticker`, `shares`, and `price`. We then create a total ownership report that computes the total value of each purchased stock.
